# Let There Be Flight

This is a mod (current in a beta state) for Cyberpunk 2077 that adds a flying mechanism to all cars, with a couple different modes and options.

Other features include:
* In-world navigation for quests and player-selected destinations (with appropriate colors)
* Imminent explosion audio indicator
* Visual explosions happen more readily with other cars
* Quick-eject in flight mode (hold exit)
